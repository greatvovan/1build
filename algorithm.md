# Building a Metal Stud Partition Wall

**Type:** interior, partition  
**Height:** 8 ft

## Materials
- Metal track (U-shaped)
- Metal stud (C-shaped)
- Drywall panels
- Screws type A (track to floor)
- Screws type B (track to ceiling)
- Screws type C (stud to walls)
- Screws type D (for fixing drywall to rakes)
- Screws type E (for connecting U-track to C-stud, optional case 2.i).

## Tools
- Screwdriver or screw gun
- Spirit level
- Measurement tape
- Pencil
- Tin snips
- Knife

## Steps
1. Do measurements and mark up the location for the frame (future wall).
1. Fix the outer frame of the wall consisting of tracks for floor and ceiling, and
   studs for walls, open side facing inside the wall.
   Cut according to measurements during the process. Tracks can be cut in pieces,
   studs must be whole from the top to the bottom.
   Use screws of types A, B, C for the floor, ceiling and walls accordingly,
   and plan putting screws with 20â€”25 inches in between,
   however they must go into timber or other hard material
   (use corresponding fasteners).  
   1. _**Note:** The assignment does not specify whether the ceiling is 8 ft or taller._  
    If fixing to the walls or ceiling is not possible, fix a whole rake between opposing
    rakes that are fixed. Use type E screws. Not more than one side of the wall can be
    fixed this way.  
   The case is not covered in the algorithm.
1. Cut stud rakes to fit between the top and bottom tracks (if necessary) and
   insert them vertically into the track frame. Plan half of a drywall panel
   width between studs (their centers).
1. Cut one drywall panel in halves (vertically) and start filling the wall with
   a half-size panel (with exception for walls that are too short).
   Mark a middle (vertical) line on whole panels to simplify
   getting into studs. Make ~1/2 inch space between the floor and bottom of a panel.
   Using type D screws, fix the panels to the studs, with ~1 ft interval.
   At panel connection points, the studs hold two panels each, so both of them
   must be fixed to a stud, on left and right side from the center line.
1. Fill the opposite side of the wall with panels similarly, but starting with
   a whole panel.
